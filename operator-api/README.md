# Build & Run


- Using bun builder

```bash
bun build # binaries : dist/kernel-operator-api , dist/kernel-operator-test
```

- Run tests from inside the kernel-images container :
  - Run tests manually

  ```bash
  # build the container ...
  # start container with DEBUG_BASH=true for interactive mode (optional)
  # needs both WITH_KERNEL_IMAGES_API=true & WITH_KERNEL_OPERATOR_API=true

  WITH_KERNEL_OPERATOR_API=true DEBUG_BASH=true IMAGE=kernel-docker WITH_KERNEL_IMAGES_API=true ENABLE_WEBRTC=true  ./run-docker.sh

  # when container launches, run tests from inside it

  /usr/local/bin/kernel-operator-test # lists available tests
  /usr/local/bin/kernel-operator-test --all # run all tests
  /usr/local/bin/kernel-operator-test fs screenshot # specify test suites
  ```

  - Autorun tests

  ```bash
  # build the container ...
  # you can set DEBUG_OPERATOR_TEST=true to auto run all tests
  # needs both WITH_KERNEL_IMAGES_API=true & WITH_KERNEL_OPERATOR_API=true

  WITH_KERNEL_OPERATOR_API=true DEBUG_OPERATOR_TEST=true IMAGE=kernel-docker WITH_KERNEL_IMAGES_API=true ENABLE_WEBRTC=true  ./run-docker.sh

  # after tests complete, you should be able to fetch the generated logs file
  # using the operator api itself, from outside the container (provided /fs/read_file works)
  curl -o tests.log "http://localhost:9999/fs/read_file?path=%2Ftmp%2Fkernel-operator%2Ftests.log"
  cat tests.log
  ```
